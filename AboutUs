We, Sakshi, Mansi and Simran (Team SMS) of Cummins College of Engineering has done this project as a part of IBM HackChallenge 2020 #IBMHackChallenge. 
Our Project is based on Twitter Sentiment Analysis in the form of Interative Visualization Dashboard to help Government of India understand the sentiments of the people behind their decisions related to control the spread of COVID-19 in the country. 

Go through the ReadMe section of this project to have a look at our Dashboard and a tour through how we made it via youtube video.
